# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- Zootopia 
- because I liked watching it 

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- Excitement 

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- Judy hops in a police uniform with her partner Nick wild and a big zootopia city, with all the main characters. All animals 
- Because this is the main focus of the movie and it captures the setting and main characters  

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- HUMANS only animals with human characteristics. I also don't want small fonts or to many characters all crammed. 

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):  sky blue, grey 
- **Accent color(s):**  police badge (gold yellowish) green, 
- **Overall mood:** bright colors colorful, hopeful upbeat 
**Composition:**  
- [ ] 
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  

- **Focal point description:**

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
A bright, colorful animated movie poster inspired by a modern animal city. In the center stands a small, confident female bunny police officer wearing a blue police uniform and gold badge. Beside her is her tall, clever fox partner standing in a relaxed but heroic pose. Behind them is a wide, glowing city skyline filled with tall buildings, train rails, greenery, and soft clouds. Several other animal citizens are placed naturally around the scene without crowding, showing many different species living together. The poster uses sky blue and light gray as dominant colors with accents of police-badge gold and bright green. The mood is exciting, hopeful, upbeat, and adventurous. The layout is clean and cinematic with bold, easy-to-read title text at the top, no clutter, no humans, no blurry images, no tiny fonts, and no overcrowded characters.
-
 It had all the elements I wanted especially the fox and bunny with a city in the back 
Zootopia was not anywhere in the poster. It said Urban Shield. 
- 
I am going to change it to say zootopia, but it might be copyrighted. 

**Attempt 2:**  
A high-quality animated movie poster set in a massive futuristic animal city at sunrise. A brave bunny police officer in a crisp blue uniform stands confidently in the foreground on a glowing street, holding her badge. Beside her is a clever fox partner with his paws in his pockets, smiling. Behind them, the huge city of Zootopia  rises with shining skyscrapers, sky rails, floating signs, and green rooftop gardens. Soft golden sunlight beams through the buildings.
Other animal citizens appear naturally in the background, not crowded, showing many species living together.The title Zootopia appears in large bold gold letters at the top.
Dominant colors are sky blue and light gray, with bright green and police-badge gold accents.
The mood is exciting, hopeful, upbeat, adventurous, cinematic, clean, colorful, no humans, no clutter, no tiny fonts, sharp focus, professional movie poster style.
-
It got closer to zootopia but not quite. 
- It cannot do zootopia because it is copyright. I will photoshop it in later


## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
Show me a Zootopia-style poster with different characters

- nothing, it chose completely wrong characters that were not in the movie, next time, I will change the prompt to specify which characters need to be in the poster. 

**Attempt 4:**  
-It made the bunny and fox appear, and made them the same height.  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  

I selected the first one because I think the more modifications I made, perplexity became 
## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  Make it say zootopia 
2.  change the bunny height 
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
